# erecord-mode
`erecord` is an Emacs mode for Mercurial/hg interactive patch recording.

It lets you filter hierarchical trees, including and excluding specific subtrees and nodes.  My initial use case is in Mercurial/hg: I want to do something like the built in Curses-based `crecord` mode, but in Emacs.
